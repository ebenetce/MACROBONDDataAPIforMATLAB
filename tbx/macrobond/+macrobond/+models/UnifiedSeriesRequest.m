% UnifiedSeriesRequest Request of a list of series converted to the same calendar
% 
% UnifiedSeriesRequest Properties:
%   frequency - The frequency to convert all series to. The default is to convert to the highest frequency of the series in the request.  1 = Annual (Once a year)  2 = SemiAnnual (One in half a year)  3 = QuadMonthly  4 = Quarterly (Once a quarter)  5 = BiMonthly (Once every 2 months)  6 = Monthly (Once a month)  7 = Weekly (Once a week)  8 = Daily (Once a day)  100 = Lowest (The lowest frequency)  101 = Highest (The highest frequency) - type: SeriesFrequency
%   weekdays - The days of the week used for daily series. The default is Monday to Friday.  1 = Sunday (Represents a Sunday)  2 = Monday (Represents a Monday)  4 = Tuesday (Represents a Tuesday)  8 = Wednesday (Represents a Wednesday)  16 = Thursday (Represents a Thursday)  31 = SundayToThursday (Sunday to Thursday daymask, weekend on Friday and Saturday)  32 = Friday (Represents a Friday)  62 = MondayToFriday (Standard five day week)  64 = Saturday (Represents a Saturday)  79 = SaturdayToWednesday (Saturday to Wednesday daymask, weekend on Thursday and Friday)  94 = MondayToThursdayAndSaturday (Monday to Thursday and Saturday, weekend on Friday and Sunday)  95 = SaturdayToThursday (Saturday to Thursday, weekend on Friday)  127 = FullWeek (All days of the week) - type: SeriesWeekdays
%   calendarMergeMode - The merge mode determines how the series calendars are used when forming the new shared calendar. The default is to use all observations that are in any calendar.  0 = FullCalendar (Include the full range implied by the frequency and weekday settings)  1 = AvailableInAll (Use points in time that are available in all calendars)  2 = AvailableInAny (Use points in time that are available in any calendar) - type: CalendarMergeMode
%   currency - The currency to use for currency conversion or omitted for no conversion. - type: string
%   startDateMode - The start date mode determines how the start date is calculated. By default the mode is to start when there is data in any series.  0 = DataInAnySeries (All the series start or end when there is data in any series)  1 = DataInAllSeries (All the series start or end when there is data in all series) - type: CalendarDateMode
%   startPoint - The start point. By default, this is determined by the startDateMode. It can be a date on the format yyyy-mm-dd or a number of observations relative the end of the series. - type: string
%   endDateMode - The end date mode determines how the end date is calculated. By default the mode is to end when there is no data in any series.  0 = DataInAnySeries (All the series start or end when there is data in any series)  1 = DataInAllSeries (All the series start or end when there is data in all series) - type: CalendarDateMode
%   endPoint - The end point. By default, this is determined by the endDateMode. It can be a date on the format yyyy-mm-dd or a number of observations relative the end of the series. - type: string
%   seriesEntries - The list of series entries that defines the series to request. - type: array of UnifiedSeriesEntry
